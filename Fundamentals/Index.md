## Introduction

The aim of this course is to develop an understanding of the science of statistics using principles of mathematics and computation through programming.

It is likely that you have come across statistics in one form or another, whether you were aware of it or not. Statistics is used to gain an understanding of data and make predictions about the future. It allows weather reporters to predict what a storm might do and doctors to understand the health of their patients or the prognosis of an illness. Statistics is applied in a wide range of areas: mathematics, economics, social sciences, trade, research, programming, Big Data, data science, health, business, government, and education [[1]](##-References). And this list is far from exhaustive.

In a statistical setting, we are concerned with the collection, analysis, and presentation of empirical data using statistical methods [[2]](##-References). Inherent to this setting are two key concepts of **uncertainty** and **variation** [[2]](##-References). In this course, you will learn to make statistical statements about populations of interest while accounting for uncertainty and variation in the analytical techniques and/or underlying data.

## Getting Started with R

The computational tool that will be used throughout this course is R. It is a "language and environment for statistical computing and graphics" [[3]](##-References). To get started, it is recommended that you download the latest version of RStudio, the integrated development environment for R that will be used in this course:
