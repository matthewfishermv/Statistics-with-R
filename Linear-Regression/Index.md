## Introduction

In the previous modules, you have seen how to design experiments and work with variables, infer properties of a population from characteristics of a sample, and compare means across two populations. We turn next to a basic modelling technique - Simple Linear Regression.

In this module, you will learn how to measure and test relationships between two variables in the same population through <ins>correlation</ins>, build and test a <ins>simple linear model</ins>, and assess the fit of a linear regression model using a <ins>global F-test</ins>.

These concepts will lay the groundwork for understanding Multiple Linear Regression and regression diagnostics in the next module.
